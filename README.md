# Streamlit_app (Multiple Disease Prediction)
This Disease Prediction Application is an educational tool developed to demonstrate how machine learning models can analyze symptoms and suggest potential diseases. Designed for learning and exploration, this application allows users to select symptoms and receive a prediction based on patterns observed in the dataset used to train the model.
Purpose and Functionality

The primary objective of this application is to provide insight into how machine learning can assist in symptom analysis. Using a comprehensive dataset that includes symptoms and corresponding diseases, the application leverages a Random Forest model to predict possible conditions. Users can interact with the model by selecting symptoms from a checklist and receiving a disease prediction. The application offers:

    Dataset Overview: A page displaying an overview of the dataset used for model training, including the prevalence and distribution of various symptoms and diseases.
    Data Visualization: Interactive charts showing symptom frequency, disease prevalence, correlations between symptoms, and feature importance for model predictions.
    Symptom Selection: A user-friendly checklist where users can mark symptoms they are experiencing and receive a prediction.
    Model Evaluation: A page showing model accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

## Technology Stack

    Python: For data handling, model training, and integration.
    Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the Random Forest model.
    Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation.
    Streamlit: To build an interactive, web-based interface.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and insights.

    The application is designed to predict the following diseases based on the dataset provided. These diseases are identified using a combination of symptoms and patterns learned by the machine learning model:

    Fungal Infection
    Allergy
    GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)
    Chronic Cholestasis
    Drug Reaction
    Peptic Ulcer Disease
    AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)
    Diabetes
    Gastroenteritis
    Bronchial Asthma
    Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
    Migraine
    Cervical Spondylosis
    Paralysis (Brain Hemorrhage)
    Jaundice
    Malaria
    Chickenpox
    Dengue
    Typhoid
    Hepatitis A
    Hepatitis B
    Hepatitis C
    Hepatitis D
    Hepatitis E
    Alcoholic Hepatitis
    Tuberculosis
    Common Cold
    Pneumonia
    Dimorphic Hemorrhoids (Piles)
    Heart Attack
    Varicose Veins
    Hypothyroidism
    Hyperthyroidism
    Hypoglycemia
